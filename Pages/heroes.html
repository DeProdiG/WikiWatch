                    <p>The first step to improve your skills with a hero is to understand its backstory.
                        This way you will start thinking as the character you play. What to do in intense moments,
                        where to hide when things go bad, etc. Here you will find an example for the support hero
                        <em><b>Moira</b></em>.</p>

                            about the evolutionary advancement of humanity. Though her work has earned her many enemies,

                        <p class="m-t">Equal parts brilliant and controversial, scientist Moira O'Deorain is on the
                            cutting
                            edge of genetic engineering, searching for a way to rewrite the fundamental building blocks
                            of life.
                            Over a decade ago, O'Deorain made waves when she published a controversial paper detailing a
                            methodology for creating custom genetic programs that could alter DNA at a cellular level.
                            It seemed like
                            a promising step toward overcoming diseases and disorders and maximizing human potential.

                        <p class="m-t">Dissent among her peers soon followed. Many considered her work to be
                            <em>dangerous</em> because of its
                            perceived ethical shortfalls, and O'Deorain was even accused of having the same unchecked
                            desire for
                            scientific advancement that some believed had caused <em>the Omnic Crisis</em>. In addition,
                            other geneticists
                            were unable to reproduce the results of O’Deorain’s research, which further called her
                            discoveries into
                            question. Instead of kickstarting her career, her paper seriously damaged <em>her reputation.</em>
